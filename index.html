        <p> The name of the tour, 9.29 HZ, is a reference to Charlie's birthdate, September 29th, as well as something more symbolic. 9.29 Hertz is a vibration of sound that is extremely powerful, but the human ear cannot hear it. Charlie said that he felt like he was singing at 9.29 Hertz and nobody could hear him, until his fans (Called ShengMi, or raw rice) found him and heard his voice.</p>
        <p> The orgin of his fan name is very funny! It is said that Charlie has to eat rice before his performances to give him energy. Coupled with the character meaning raw, 生, being very similar in pronounciation as Charlie's name Shen, or 深, the name 生米 raw rice was born!</p>
        <p> Charlie has a very unique voice. He is a countertenor. Therefore, many say his voice sounds feminine due to his high range and his voice resulted in a lot of backlash and judgement in his earlier years.But now, Charlie is a global sensation with a large fanbase around the world!</p>
